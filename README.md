I made most of the back end, and some of the front end things.
Corporation of mongodb API, and build connection between pages, allowing owners to store data inside
the database and for the users to retrieve data from databases.
I also build the google authentication api, successfully assign status of owner and user to people
logged in according to their email address. I was planned to also divide into two different user
phase: User and Owner, but due to the time, I did not finish yet.
Also, I build the profile function that the user can enter their zip code, and we could search the
storage according to their location in the future.
